This format doesn't supply any category/type information for the subject of the phenotype associations - which makes it a challenge whether to produce a gene to phenotype association vs a genotype to phenotype association.</p> <p>This ingest solves that problem by download gene, allele and genotype files and using a post-procesing step to create lookup lists of all genes, alleles and genotypes so that a category can be assigned in the ingest process. This runs in the Makefile under the target <code>post-download</code>.  Within the koza transformation, the lists of genes, alleles and genotypes are loaded as lookup maps.</p>"},{"location":"#filtering","title":"Filtering","text":"<p>This pipeline only captures phenotype associations which are expressed as a phenotype term, not handling post-composed phenotype annotations.
